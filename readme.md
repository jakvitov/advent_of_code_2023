# Advent of code 2023 - my Go solutions
This repository contains my solutions of tasks included in the Advent of code 2023. 

## Structure
The code is structured to packages representing each days challenge. Each of the challenges has its central method, that after being
called from the main solves the days puzzle.

## Approach
Due to time limitations, I trust the author, that input is valid and reasonably structured and do not perform unnecessary checks, because of the nature of the Advent of code problems. 

The code is sometimes messy, since I unfortunately don´t have the time to read the code twice, once it´s working and optimalise it 
or make it nicer.
